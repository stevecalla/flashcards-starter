## Functionality

* TBD
* TBD
* TBD

* Enhancements:
    * Improved the start and end game layout and description.
    * Added "process.exit(0)" to line 40 of util.js to programatically return the user to the prompt at the end of the game.
    * Added a blue circle ðŸ”µ emoji for correct answers and red circle ðŸ”´ emoji for incorrect answers.
    * Removed unnecessary server related code in the index.js file.
    * TBD


* Future Enhancements:
    * More practice: Add functionality so that a score of less than 90% will require the user to go through the entire dataset again.
    * Review incorrect answers: Add functionality so that the Round (and thus, the Game) does not end after youâ€™ve gone through all of the cards. The player should then be prompted to try to guess again, reviewing only those cards that are stored as incorrect.
    * Timer: At the end of the game, report how much time it took to complete the game (in minutes and seconds).
    * Report Card: At the end of the game, create a report card that would detail any answers that the user got wrong as well as how many tries each question took.
    * Options for mixed datasets: At the beginning of the game, give options for choosing to study different subjects (have a dataset for one subject and another subject), as well as the option for mixing all of the subjects together.

* Known Issues/Bugs:
    * None at this time.
